##Tuples are similar to list with a difference of immutability. That means once a tuple is made, the objects at
## any index position cannot be changed. Again tuples can hold mixure of data types

# E.g myTuple = ('abhishek',450)
tuple = ('abhishek',345,678)
print(tuple[0]) #abhishek
print(tuple[-1]) #678
